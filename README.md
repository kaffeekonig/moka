About Me
I have worked as a Systems Engineer for 12 years and shifted into a DevOps Engineer role for a change of pace. It has been more of a learning curve than expected. This project is to grow my tool base and record my personal exercises for future reference. I am working towards my CKAD and AZ400 for some proof of knowledge. The end goal is to grow into an SRE/Cloud Architect.
